Description
"""""""""""

.. versionadded:: TBD

The *mwlc* angle style models a meltable wormlike chain and can be used
to model non-linear bending elasticity of polymers, e.g. DNA.  *mwlc*
uses a potential that is a canonical-ensemble superposition of a
non-melted and a melted state :ref:`(Farrell) <Farrell>`.  The potential
is

.. math::

    E = -k_{B}T\,\log [q + q^{m}] + E_{0},

where the non-melted and melted partition functions are

.. math::
    q = \exp [-k_{1}(1+\cos{\theta})/k_{B}T]; \\
    q^{m} = \exp [-(\mu+k_{2}(1+\cos{\theta}))/k_{B}T].

:math:`k_1` is the bending elastic constant of the non-melted state,
:math:`k_2` is the bending elastic constant of the melted state,
:math:`\mu` is the melting energy, and
:math:`T` is the reference temperature.
The reference energy,

.. math::
    E_{0} = -k_{B}T\,\log [1 + \exp[-\mu/k_{B}T]],

ensures that E is zero for a fully extended chain.

This potential is a continuous version of the two-state potential
introduced by :ref:`(Yan) <Yan>`.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
:doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* :math:`k_1` (energy)
* :math:`k_2` (energy)
* :math:`\mu` (energy)
* :math:`T` (temperature)
